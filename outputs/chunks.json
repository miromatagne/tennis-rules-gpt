Preferably, halves of the draw are scheduled together, if that is not possible then quarters are scheduled together. Players playing singles on Monday and Thursday should be avoid-ed; however, halves of the draw should be kept together. Inclement weather can adversely a \\ufb00 ect the schedule as well as the fair treat-\\nment of the players unless these priorities are followed.\\n Rain Delayed Semi- \\ufb01 nal, When to Play Final?\\nCase:  Rain on Saturday prevents both semi- \\ufb01 nal singles from being \\nplayed. The second semi- \\ufb01 nal is played on Sunday morning, with \\nthe winner due to play the \\ufb01 nal that afternoon. Can the winner of the \\nsecond semi- \\ufb01 nal insist on a Monday \\ufb01 nal?\\nDecision: No. Every e \\ufb00 ort must be made to \\ufb01 nish the tournament \\non Sunday. The winner of the second semi- \\ufb01 nal should be given \\nthe maximum amount of rest possible before playing the \\ufb01 nal. (ATP \\nPolicy)\\n Moving Indoors at an Outdoor event\\nCase: Rain has disrupted play to the point where the event is in \\ndanger of not being completed. There are indoor courts available for use. May the Supervisor move the matches indoors to complete this event?\\nDecision: Yes. Under the responsibilities of the Supervisor it states \\nthat \\u201cthe Supervisor may, if necessary to eliminate the possibility of a player having to play two singles matches in one day, or if neces-sary to complete the event, move a match to another court, indoors or outdoors, regardless of surface\\u201d. The exception to this is if the Tournament Director demonstrates to the Supervisor that there will be a detrimental impact on the success of the tournament if singles or doubles matches are played indoors. In this case, the Supervisor may elect to keep all matches for outdoor play. (ATP Policy)\\n176VII. THE COMPETITION\\n7.22  On-Court Procedures and  Requirements\\nA.
